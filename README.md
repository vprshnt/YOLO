# YOLO
YOLO Object Detection Using OpenCV And Python || Python Project

Firstly I learned how to collect data and label it using labelImg. Then using glob, functool, pandas I learned how to create a data frame
## Converting for yolo

## ERRORS:
df[cols] = df[cols].astype(int) was noot working and i had to instead use df[cols] = df[cols].astype(int)

## Splitting the data

## label encoding
convert obj names into specific ids

## Creating a Folder structure
train and test folder. save the training images andrespective label information in .txt
in .txt file we have to save without commas
